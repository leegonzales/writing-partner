## Interview

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Material usage rate | **95%** | Nearly all interview points made it to draft |
| Ground truth preserved | **Yes** | All examples are real (AI Talk Show, stickers, Indie Dev Dan) |
| Depth achieved | **Phase 3** | Full protocol completed |
| Fabrications detected | **1 removed** | Original banana story was invented; replaced with real origin |

**Interview friction:**
- None significant. Structured questioning with multiple-choice sped things up.
- User provided rich custom answers that exceeded option choices.

## Thread Tracking

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Threads marked | **8** | 3 MAIN, 2 TANGENT, 1 COUNTER, 2 SPARK |
| Threads lost | **0** | All tracked threads addressed |
| Surfacing accuracy | **100%** | Threads surfaced at natural points |
| Resolution rate | **87%** | 7/8 made it to draft (NotebookLM woven in, not separate section) |

**Thread types:**
- MAIN: 3 (Skill+MCP combo, AI Talk Show origin, seamless workflow)
- TANGENT: 2 (NotebookLM inspiration, mind boggles possibility space)
- RESEARCH: 1 (SCTD framework provenance)
- COUNTER: 1 (Fabricated banana story—addressed by removal)
- SPARK: 1 (All four reasons for "fun"—woven into tone)

**Thread friction:**
- None. Inline marking worked smoothly.

## Voice Calibration

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Prose-polish estimate | **~18** | Well below 25 threshold |
| Blocklist matches | **0** | No Tier 1 or Tier 2 patterns |
| Revisions for voice | **0** | User kept all 3 flagged spots as-is |
| Lee's recognition | **TBD** | Pending Lee's read of final draft |

**Voice friction:**
- Minimal. Three surgical spots identified; all deemed acceptable.
- Draft captured "FML" and "you know?" voice naturally.

## Overall Assessment

**Would use output as-is?**
- [x] Yes
- [ ] Minor edits needed
- [ ] Significant rework needed

**Key friction points:**
1. None significant

**What worked well:**
1. Structured interviewing with AskUserQuestion sped up Phase 1-3
2. Real stories replaced fabricated origin naturally
3. User corrections (SCTD provenance, current friction point) integrated immediately
4. Light-touch calibration respected user's judgment

**Suggested skill improvements:**
1. Consider adding "energy tracking" during interview (user's custom answers had more heat than selected options)
2. Structured questions worked but custom answers were richest—balance needed

## Patterns Discovered

**New blocklist candidates:**
- None identified this session

**Good phrases captured:**
- "Scale the compute, scale yourself" (Indie Dev Dan)
- "FML. But it's my job, you know?"
- "Personalized, weird, delightful"

**Thread tracking improvements:**
- Inline marking sufficient for single-session work
- No need for file-based persistence in this case

## Comparison: Original v1 vs. Interview-Based v2

| Dimension | v1 (Original) | v2 (This Session) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Origin story | Invented banana incident | Real: AI Talk Show |
| Core insight | Workflow > model (abstract) | Scale compute, scale yourself (attributed) |
| Examples | Generic/hypothetical | Real: stickers, infographics, Talk Show |
| Voice | Solid but documentary | More playful, "FML", personal |
| Fabrications | 1 (banana story) | 0 |

---

## Session Verdict

**The writing-partner skill worked.**

Interview extracted real material. Threads stayed tracked. Voice calibration caught nothing major because the draft was built from ground truth, not generation.

Key validation: The fabricated banana story was identified and replaced with a real origin story that's more compelling anyway.
