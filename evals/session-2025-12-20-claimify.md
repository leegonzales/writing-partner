# Session Eval: Claimify (Day 3)

**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Duration:** ~45 minutes (across context compaction)
**Output:** `test-cases/day-3-claimify-v2-draft.md`

## Interview

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Material usage rate | **90%** | All major interview points in draft |
| Ground truth preserved | **Yes** | Real origin (hot garbage essays), real example (METR) |
| Depth achieved | **Phase 3** | Full protocol: origin, usage, core insight, tone/scope |
| Fabrications detected | **0** | Original red-team example was noted as constructed → replaced with real METR analysis |

**Interview friction:**
- None significant
- Structured interviewing with AskUserQuestion sped up decisions
- Context compaction required persisting interview notes before continuing

**Key discoveries:**
- Original draft's "meeting summary" framing was wrong
- Real angle: epistemic self-defense, memetic warfare
- Six-type taxonomy emerged from Claude research synthesis (like SCTD in Day 2)

## Thread Tracking

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Threads marked | **8** | 3 MAIN, 2 TANGENT, 2 RESEARCH, 1 COUNTER |
| Threads lost | **0** | All tracked threads addressed |
| Surfacing accuracy | **100%** | Threads integrated at natural points |
| Resolution rate | **100%** | 8/8 resolved (Microsoft paper linked post-session) |

**Thread types:**
- MAIN: Epistemic self-defense, wire into every system, intentional + unintentional manipulation
- TANGENT: Better writer AND thinker, six-type taxonomy (honest provenance)
- RESEARCH: Microsoft paper origin, METR report example
- COUNTER: Current draft examples weak → addressed with real METR analysis

**Thread friction:**
- None. Interview notes file preserved threads across context compaction.

## Voice Calibration

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Prose-polish estimate | **~16** | Well below 25 threshold |
| Blocklist matches | **0** | No Tier 1 or Tier 2 patterns post-edit |
| Revisions for voice | **2** | Both selected via structured interviewing |
| Lee's recognition | **TBD** | Pending Lee's read of final draft |

**Calibration edits:**
1. "That sounds dramatic. Here's why it's not." → "That's not hyperbole—it's the logical endpoint."
2. "Guard your information ecology." → "Wire it into every system that puts tokens in your mind. Guard the ecology."

**Voice notes:**
- More serious/urgent tone than Days 1-2 (as requested)
- Opening from interview: "well-written hot garbage"
- Strong first-person ownership throughout
- Conviction with nuance (not hedging core claims)

---

## Overall Assessment

**Would use output as-is?**
- [ ] Yes
- [x] Minor edits needed (2 calibration edits applied)
- [ ] Significant rework needed

**Key friction points:**
1. Context compaction mid-session → mitigated by persisting interview notes to file
2. Subagent for METR analysis added latency → worth it for real example

**What worked well:**
1. Structured interviewing eliminated ambiguity at each decision point
2. Real METR example replaced constructed red-team example
3. Tone shift to more serious/urgent successfully executed
4. Calibration presented choices, user selected, edits applied cleanly

**Suggested skill improvements:**
1. Consider auto-persisting interview notes before long operations (subagents, etc.)
2. Structured interviewing for calibration worked better than open-ended suggestions

## Comparison: Original Draft vs. Interview-Based v2

| Dimension | Original | v2 (This Session) |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Framing | Meeting summary tool | Epistemic self-defense |
| Origin story | Stakeholder meetings (composite) | Hot garbage essays (real) |
| Example | Constructed red-team | Real METR report analysis |
| Tone | Moderate | Serious, urgent |
| Taxonomy source | Unstated | Honest: Claude research synthesis |
| Core message | Useful tool | Guard your mind from manipulation |

## Thread Map from Interview

```
### MAIN
1. Epistemic self-defense — guard mind from manipulation ✓
2. Wire Claimify into everything that puts tokens in mind ✓
3. Both intentional and unintentional bad arguments ✓

### TANGENT
4. Better writer AND thinker (dual purpose) ✓
5. Six-type taxonomy (honest provenance) ✓

### RESEARCH
6. Microsoft paper origin — LINKED ✓
7. METR report example ✓

### COUNTER
8. Current draft examples weak — replaced with METR ✓
```

## Patterns Discovered

**New blocklist candidates:**
- None identified this session

**Good phrases captured:**
- "Well-written hot garbage"
- "Wire it into every system that puts tokens in your mind"
- "That's not hyperbole—it's the logical endpoint"
- "Guard the ecology"

**Session technique improvements:**
- Structured interviewing for calibration is faster than presenting prose alternatives
- Persisting interview notes to file before heavy operations prevents loss

---

## Session Verdict

**The writing-partner skill worked on a more complex essay.**

Key validations:
1. Interview extracted the real angle (epistemic self-defense, not meetings)
2. Real example (METR analysis) replaced constructed placeholder
3. Voice calibration via structured questions was efficient
4. More serious tone achieved without losing Lee's voice markers

Key difference from Day 2: The original draft had the wrong framing entirely. Interview-driven rewrite was necessary, not optional.
