# Interview Transcript: Writing Partner System Design

**Date:** 2025-12-18
**Subject:** Lee Gonzales
**Interviewer:** Claude
**Context:** Designing a writing partner skill, using prose-polish essay revision as test case

---

## The Setup

Lee wanted to sharpen the prose-polish essay (Day 1 of 12 Days series). Initial observation: the essay was written BY a prior Claude, not BY Lee, and doesn't feel like his voice.

**Game ON / Game OFF Protocol:**
- **Game ON** = Doing the actual work (interviewing, drafting)
- **Game OFF** = Stepping outside to introspect on process and document system

---

## Questions and Answers

### Q1: Why this essay first?

**Lee:** "Frankly it was the first one in the list, and the one that jumped out in a quick scan as needing more of my attention."

**Insight:** Selection was pragmatic (first in list) + intuitive (needed attention). Not overthought.

---

### Q2: What's the core insight readers should remember?

**Lee:** "Prose polish is about elevating writing, AI writing, human writing, it is intending to be an intellectual prosthesis, in the same way claimify is. In fact they are intended to synergize with each other. Also worth noting a prior claude wrote most of prose polish, with some light guidance directionally from me, and it is not half bad, but does not presently feel like I wrote it. And I want to change that."

**Insight:**
- Core concept: **intellectual prosthesis** for writing elevation
- Synergy with claimify (both prosthetic tools)
- The problem: "does not presently feel like I wrote it"
- Goal: authentic voice, not just competent prose

---

### Q3: What feels thin?

**Lee:** "There are elements that are fabrications if I say its from me, I need to change that. Either we need to say these are hypotheticals or we need to get to more ground truth of why I like prose polish and why I had us make it."

**Insight:**
- Fabrications need to be addressed
- Two options: mark as hypothetical OR replace with ground truth
- Need to surface LEE's actual reasons, not Claude's inventions

---

### Q4: How did you write the original?

**Lee:** "I provided light direction. And directed claude to build an essay with that plus the skill."

**Insight:** The essay emerged from Claude with minimal Lee input. This is WHY it doesn't sound like him—there's no "him" in it beyond direction.

---

### Q5: Where does your attention snag when re-reading?

**Lee:** "I get stuck on the points that seem to come from me, but that are clearly hallucinations or creative license from a prior claude."

**Insight:** The snags are at fabrication points. His attention catches where Claude invented "his" experience.

---

### Q6: Why did you actually build prose-polish?

**Lee:** "I made prose polish to make my writing better, and to improve your (claudes) writing."

**Insight:** Dual purpose—elevate BOTH human and AI writing. Not just detection, but improvement.

---

### Q7: What's your actual experience with AI-sounding writing?

**Lee:** "My writing is not always great, and I like to elevate it. But really I like to write prompts and have writing be a form of emergence from a conversation with AIs. Think, turn an AI chat into an essay."

**Insight:**
- **Collaborative emergence** — essays emerge from AI conversation
- Not using AI as a generator, but as a conversation partner
- The chat IS the raw material

---

### Q8: Is the "Corporate Opening Gambit" pattern real?

**Lee:** "That was not real. The pattern I most observe that is the AI tell I can't stand is the pattern 'You might think Y... but actually let me show why its actually X' and all of its derivations. I also can't stand the lack of writing perplexity, perfectly crafted sentences that are grammatically perfect, but soulless and lack some animating spirit. My goal in partner writing with AI is to provide the spark of my human taste, vision and wisdom and use AI as an intellectual prosthesis to help fill in all of the words, and elevate the writing."

**Insight:**
- **Corporate Opening Gambit was Claude's invention**, not Lee's observation
- Lee's REAL AI tell: **"You might think Y... but actually X"**
- Other tells: lack of perplexity, grammatically perfect but soulless
- His philosophy: **human provides spark/taste/vision/wisdom, AI provides words/elevation**
- Key term again: **intellectual prosthesis**

---

### Q9: What about real examples?

**Lee:** "Perhaps we can find three examples and replace the salesforce example with writing from some public sources that are very AI like or just not very good. and then find really good writing and use prose polish on both and be able to show the results."

**Insight:** Replace fabricated Salesforce example with:
- Real AI-like or low-quality public writing
- Real high-quality writing
- Show prose-polish results on both
- Evidence over invention

---

### Q10: What would "this feels like I wrote it" actually mean?

**Lee:** "I write to explore ideas, I write to tell people a story, change or expand a mind, demonstrate expertise, sell a position, or communicate an emotion leading to a thought. I write to exhort, compel, inspire, and drive people. I write to think out loud (I am an external processor, the number of times I catch myself monologuing in a conversation because I am thinking out loud, and my best ideas or clarity often comes in that form, which I now do with AIs, is a lot. So what sounds like me, heartfelt writing that I can see my own mind shine through."

**Insight:**
- Writing purposes: explore, tell stories, change minds, demonstrate expertise, sell, communicate emotion
- Verbs: exhort, compel, inspire, drive
- **External processor** — thinks out loud, monologues to clarity
- Now does this with AIs
- Authentic signal: "heartfelt writing that I can see my own mind shine through"

---

### Q11: What does emergence from AI conversation look like?

**Lee:** "I start with all of those things, but more often than not it's more like... I wonder about, or hey go research this topic and then let's talk about it. That is idea exploration or just being curious. Or sometimes, and this is one of my favorite examples of working with AIs, I might say, hey let's explore the intersection of these completely different thinkers or sets of ideas. For example what is the intersection or confluence of ideas that come from Simon Wardley or Miyamoto Musashi... or what is the exaptation of ideas from one domain to another."

**Insight:**
- Entry points: "I wonder about...", "go research this and let's talk"
- **Intersection exploration** — combining distant thinkers (Wardley + Musashi)
- **Exaptation** — ideas from one domain to another
- Curiosity-driven, not outline-driven

---

### Q12: What's the payoff of the intersection move?

**Lee:** "Novel insights yes, but also just helping to expand my own understanding of the world. This can lead to novel insights, practical tools, and yes the pleasure of filling in more deeply my understanding of the world. Richer models, better and higher fidelity maps."

**Insight:**
- Not just clever connections
- Expands understanding
- Leads to: novel insights, practical tools, pleasure of understanding
- Goal: **richer models, higher fidelity maps**

---

### Q13: Is AI prosthesis or collaborator?

**Lee:** "AI can be both, a mind expander, a collaborator and intellectual foil."

**Insight:** Not either/or. AI is:
- Mind expander
- Collaborator
- Intellectual foil
- All three depending on moment

---

### Q14: What does AI do during monologue-to-clarity?

**Lee:** "It does all of those things, if you look at my custom instructions you can see the different ways I like to debate and think."

**Insight:** Points to existing system—reasoner roster, archetypes. These are already codified in CLAUDE.md.

---

### Q15: Reasoner roster selection—intuitive or deliberate?

**Lee:** "I mainly just let the AI figure that out, it is delightful seeing dissident poet show up on occasion although sometimes I will name thinkers I want to invoke, but it is rare."

**Insight:**
- **AI-driven selection** (emergent)
- **Delight in surprise** when unexpected voice appears
- Override possible but rare
- Names specific thinkers occasionally

---

### Q16: Modes vs. fluid context-sensing?

**Lee:** "Fluid and context sensing, the prompt has directions on how to choose thinkers and approach."

**Insight:**
- **No explicit mode switches**
- Fluid, context-sensing
- Prompt guides the AI
- Already built into his system

---

### Q17: How do you track threads?

**Lee:** "Write down, note with a marker for later and surface them as we go."

**Insight:**
- **Explicit tracking** (write down)
- **Markers** for later surfacing
- **Surface as we go** — not all at end
- System should manage this, not his head

---

### Q18: When does thread surfacing feel right vs. intrusive?

**Lee:** "Oh I can track and don't mind, frankly love digressions and side quests, that is totally how my mind works, ideally bringing things back together. I am deeply intuitive and often I will say or think something and then later on in my thinking or a conversation things will come back and I will figure out the connection that was happening or bubbling down in my subconscious that sort of snap into reality is delightful and often signals a novel or powerful insight."

**Insight:**
- **Loves digressions and side quests**
- Mind works by diverging then converging
- Deeply intuitive
- **Subconscious processing** — things bubble, then "snap into reality"
- Those snaps = novel/powerful insights
- Don't force premature convergence

---

### Q19: What's the minimum viable version?

**Lee:** "I mean why not all three."

**Insight:** Wants integrated system: interview + thread tracking + voice calibration. Not willing to pick one.
