# Expectations for Engineers and Engineering Teams

**TL;DR — Individual Performance Expectations**

1. Prioritize and Execute. Thoughtfully make an impact every day and over time.
2. Be a teammate people trust and enjoy working with. Earn trust every day.
3. Grow yourself and others. Be an active learner. Be a force multiplier. Lead!

This essay is intended to be an all-weather take on what high-performance engineers and engineering teams look like, how they behave, and what they deliver.

## Excellence looks like

- Reliably and quickly deliver outstanding business results via technology.
- Be a teammate people trust and love working with.
- Be highly competent across multiple domains and technologies.
- Gracefully make tradeoffs against multiple conflicting constraints.
- Aggressively overcome obstacles to deliver amazing results.
- Support our systems to deliver delightful, valuable, and trustworthy experiences.
- Focus on learning and improving your skills and abilities.
- Enable the people around you to succeed now and in the future.
- Grow and improve our engineering culture and practices.
- Ensure we are ready for what may come tomorrow.

**NOTE:** The engineering team is accountable for meeting the following expectations. Note that these expectations are not intended to be a checklist but should be thought of as a growth path that will lead towards becoming more mature, capable, and effective as individuals and as a coherent team.

**NOTE:** Engineers are responsible for actively pursuing the behaviors, habits, and mental models listed below, as this is how we will realize our mission which is the delivery of superb systems that deliver important, valuable solutions to our customers.

## Core Competencies

First and foremost, engineering teams must demonstrate the ability to design, build, deliver, operate and manage systems/applications. This means that they:

- Reliably deliver features, bug fixes, and enhancements as forecast (estimated).
- Ship multiple complete (idea to running system) solutions per quarter.
- Maintain an awareness of business priorities and make necessary adjustments.
- Provide accurate estimates. Provide confidence intervals and strive to improve their forecasting ability. Mature engineers, more often than not, can hit their targets.
- Build and maintain safe and secure production systems. Security and safeguarding our customer's data are always a consideration in the code we write and the systems we deliver.
- Proactively raise issues and risks affecting development timelines and system operations.
- Seek to provide clarity on business impacts when issues or problems occur.
- Actively plan to replan. Treat issues and risks as normal. Handle them with aplomb and finesse.
- Act as effective system owners with deep system knowledge, proactive system maintenance, and depth of operational understanding, which is well documented.
- Proven ability to select, design, and implement appropriate systems architectures and technologies.

## Teamwork and Leadership

Engineers and engineering teams must exhibit capable teaming, leadership, communication behaviors, and skills. Excellent teamwork looks like this:

- Clear, concise, and effective communication (intra-team and inter-team).
- Actively recognize that feedback is a gift. Seek to provide it with compassion.
- Keep the team informed of what you are working on, challenges, and lessons learned.
- Set clear expectations on delivery and deliver on time. Changes are expected but must be communicated along with potential risks and issues.
- Ensure your efforts and plans align with the Product and Engineering Roadmap.
- Take opportunities to share our work and plans with other teams.
- Seek to be kind and enthusiastic in your collaboration.
- Work together to define the engineering and product roadmap.
- Actively seek input/perspective/feedback from team members.
- Provide an atmosphere where team members feel comfortable asking for help. Foster psychological safety.
- Provide honest and supportive feedback to your manager and other team members. Keep one another accountable for actions and outcomes.
- Put the team's needs before your self-interests. We win as a team.
- Ensure you are not a "bottleneck." Actively work to decrease the team's "lottery winner" factor risks. Help with cross-training.

## Engineering Process

Engineers and teams must possess a highly effective engineering process and professional operating system. That looks like:

- Focus on learning, be consistently curious, and actively engage with the growth of yourself and those around you. Strive to do a little better every day.
- Create a culture of self-improvement and knowledge sharing. Demonstrate self-awareness of your shortcomings or knowledge gaps, and model an "always be improving" orientation.
- The ability to deliver high-quality code which is: (1) Readable, Robust, Reusable, (2) Efficient (without premature over-optimization), (3) Well-balanced abstractions (without over-engineering), and (4) Delivered per our agreed-upon guidelines, processes, and policies.
- Thorough test coverage with a thought-out strategy aligned with the systems and business needs.
- Review others' code in a timely fashion with a critical eye. Provide honest and supportive feedback. Pick your battles, and don't nitpick.
- Think deeply about our Architecture/Platform/Systems so that we will build sustainable business advantages in the form of leverage.
- Long-term architectural thinking without over-engineering: remember, we are building a company, not just products. Systems only matter if they are used. Functionality is an asset, but code is a liability.
- Decouple components where possible and provide clean, consistent, and versioned APIs.
- Pragmatically use the right technologies and methods.
- Be paranoid and take protective measures against data loss and security/privacy breaches.
- Explore and apply new technologies with a critical and pragmatic approach.
- Be thoughtful about algorithms, frameworks, and technologies. That means: (1) Know the literature and apply principles appropriately. (2) Think creatively and be open-minded to new/radical ideas. (3) Prototype first and make data-informed decisions.

## Key Engineering Measures

On-going and thoughtful improvement regarding key engineering measures:

- **Value:** Always look for new opportunities to provide value to our customers and team by leveraging data and smart design.
- **Quality:** Ensure we have clear metrics around quality and work to continually improve them.
- **Performance:** we benchmark, meet, and exceed our SLA/SLI/SLOs.
- **Agility:** Strive for tooling, practices, and systems that facilitate rapid, incremental iteration of our systems.
- **Transparency:** Systems should be made query-able/inspect-able whenever possible. Think telemetry and observability.

## Operations

Responsible and thoughtful systems maintenance and operations.

- Engaged participation in the Operational aspects of our systems
- Maintain three 9's uptime on all production systems we own.
- Participate in a 24/7 response by being on call.
- Be cost-conscious and plan to scale economically.

## Responsiveness

Responsiveness to other teams (i.e., customer-focused)

- Timely acknowledgment of issues. Support tickets are acknowledged within 24 hours of filing. Clear expectations/plan is communicated if no immediate action is available. Over-communicate and be empathic.
- Provide compassionate recognition and empathy with the emotional nature of customer issues, bugs, or defects.
- Actively make recommendations based on bugs found/fixed. Treat data "bugs" as a learning and improvement opportunity rather than an annoyance.
- Collaborate on cross-team processes and tools to pinpoint and diagnose issues.

## Culture Building

Enthusiastic evangelism, hiring, onboarding, and promotion.

- "Always be selling" when attending events.
- Assist in reviewing incoming resumes and phone screens.
- Maintain high standards and not "butts in chairs."
- Attend meetups, conferences, and community events as a means to learn while also building our brand.
- Assist in training new team members and ensuring their success.
