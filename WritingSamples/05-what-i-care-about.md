# What I Care About

I work hard to care for and help people as a whole. I consider it important whether or not people are flourishing, getting feedback, feeling happy, and joyful.

I strive to make certain that those in my care are getting what they need to do their best work. I deeply care if a person's family is doing well, if they are doing meaningful work, and that their situation is fair. Keeping in mind fair does not mean equal, it means appropriate for the individual.

I care about how we work. Are we living our values? Are we acting with courage and integrity? Are our employees' needs and our customers needs first and foremost in our decision making?

I often wonder, is our system effective and are we constantly getting better? And not just getting better, but are we getting better… at getting better.

I care about results. And whether we are measuring and delivering what we said we would - and are we paying attention to ensure that we are actually delivering what is truly needed. Situational awareness is paramount.

I believe that results come in many forms and that most anything important can be measured, tracked and improved. Some things that matter are harder to measure, but that is not a reason not to try.*

## How I Think

I think of most everything I encounter as either a complex system or the result of a complex system. Therefore I spend a lot of time thinking about and tuning systems to achieve probabilistic outcomes I want to occur. In general what I most want to occur is the joyful flourishing of humans. I derive joy and satisfaction from building systems (software, human, etc) that deliver delightful outcomes across many dimensions. I focus immensely on efficiently and effectively delivering outstanding outcomes for the people I care about. I also seek to transform most situations into Infinite games where the most people possible can WIN and keep playing for as long as they desire.

## My Engineering Philosophy

Always keep the end in mind. We deliver business value in the form of high-quality software systems. Be rigorous and methodological while maintaining an incremental and iterative development approach. Place smart bets to learn and discern both the problems and solutions. Seek to learn constantly, actively question your assumptions. Make data-driven, evidence-based decisions. Strive to be Less Wrong, pay attention to your biases and blind spots. Understand system performance, actively develop measures, metrics, and SLAs. Focus on maintaining a qualitative understanding of the customer experience. Pro-actively seek counsel and insights from peers, stakeholders, and experts.

## How to Best Communicate with Me

I really like emails followed up with in-person communication. I like to digest and think about things before I have to make a decision or give guidance. For big decisions, I prefer 24 hours or more of time. I like to meet and talk over meals and beverages. I prefer straight talk, not overt diplomacy. I like to hear the bad news first and as early as possible. Even if the news later proves to be wrong or less worrying than first appeared. I like it when people bring both problems and solutions, however, if you don't know the solution don't be afraid to bring problems and issues to me. I will help and I will listen regardless. I strive to truly and deeply listen. I try to ask questions rather than give solutions, although this is a problem for me. I usually and wrongly jump straight to problem-solving when I need to slow down. I really like solving problems and a core part of my identity is a creative problem solver.

## How to Make Decisions Around Me

Determine if a decision is reversible and what the downside risks are of a wrong choice. Then move to make a decision as quickly as is prudent based on those criteria. If those risks are manageable and the decision is reversible make decisions when you are 60% certain based on measurable, specific data. Unpack your problems, use first principles, and ask Fermi style questions. If a decision is not reversible seek counsel from others and go as slow as needed to get it right. Be a fox, not a hedgehog.

## We Are All Leaders

Leadership and ownership are really important to me. I will give you ownership and responsibility of a situation if I think you are (1) committed to achieving a positive outcome (2) qualified or could quickly become qualified to responsibly own the domain (3) willing and able to constantly communicate on the situation. I expect people to step up and take their initiative in any and all situations. Leaders lead. Leaders put skin the game and play to win. Leaders demonstrate our values and act with courageous integrity to get results for the team, not for themselves. Leaders recognize that it takes a team and that failures happen. Leaders learn and improve.

## People Earn My Trust and Respect When They…

Act and speak with forthright candor, integrity, and courage. Provide constant, compassionate, appropriately respectful feedback. Take ownership and initiative to deliver high-quality results aligned with true needs. Argue about facts, not feelings. Stay calm, but exhibit appropriate urgency and enthusiasm. Work to build up their team and ask how they can help. Celebrate failure and learning.

## What I Will NOT Tolerate

Disrespect in all its forms. A lack of ownership and attention to one's craft. Inattention to the details and consistently missing clearly stated expectations. Rude behavior or a lack of courtesy. The acceptance of fixable problems and repeatedly unforced errors.

## Glossary

**Believable people:** a person who is a recognized authority in a topic or matter. They will have informed, educated opinions and can be trusted to make logical, rational decisions in a given domain.

**Feedback:** The thoughtful gift we give each other to help each other get better. Like all considerate gifts, it is packaged up nicely, delivered promptly and accepted as is. Like all gifts you don't have to keep it or even accept it, but if it is kindly given you have to listen and make sure you understand what was meant and why it was delivered.

**Positive intent:** the way I think people intend to treat me via actions and words. I assume people are doing their best and want to help us all achieve our goals in alignment with our values.

**Meetings:** places where people get together in an appropriately sized group to learn, listen and prepare to act. Meetings have agendas, finite attendees and clear expected outcomes. People use meetings to present data and facts to facilitate a decision. Or they may exist to share and disposition the outcomes of actions taken by teams, task forces or individuals. Meetings are not for gossip, complaining, whining or general chit-chat. Meetings are expensive, often costing hundreds or thousands of dollars an hour.

**Responsible party:** a person who is the owner of a process, outcome or result. Any situation, outcome or result can have only ONE responsible party. All processes, outcomes or results need a responsible party.

**System owner:** a person who is the responsible party for a system and its results. They are either a believable person with regard to the system or they actively consult those that are. They ensure that systems are documented, operating correctly, getting the business results needed, and well planned and managed.

**1:1 Person A to Person B:** the weekly or biweekly meeting I like to have with peers, colleagues, and reports to maintain our relationship, listen, help where possible, and generally keep my ears open for tasks, risks, concerns, and potentially guidance on systems, results.

**Weekly team meetings:** operates with a shared agenda, where we discuss topics of substance, make plans for the future, address issues and work to learn and improve.

**Data-driven decision making:** how we make decisions as responsible, thoughtful people. Also called using science. Data-driven decision making is how we make investment decisions, product prioritization, plan work sequences and really nearly anything. When hiring we gather multiple objective viewpoints, compare notes and as objectively as we can muster make an informed choice.

**Tech debt:** the deliberate choice not to do work which has a high probability (< 75%) of actually needing to be done in the next 12 months. Not to be confused with premature optimization which is where you choose to do work that has a low (> 40%) probability of being used in the next 12 months. The best engineers deliberately make data-driven decisions to take on tech debt intentionally. Tech debt is often accrued without care or consideration, this is bad practice. Fixing tech debt definitionly means that a known payback will likely occur. Perhaps long-term maintenance costs will decrease, system stability will increase or future system updates will be faster. If you can't objectively measure the results of the tech debt work you probably should spend your time doing something else.

**Leverage:** business or technical, often when we build a system or process we are building up leverage for future work. When we build up systems which help us sell more subscriptions we are building leverage. If we adopt tools that help us work faster and avoid mistakes we are building leverage. The more leverage we have, the more power we can apply, the more quickly we can move, the more effective we can be, the more money we will make, the more enjoyable our work will be, the more fun we can have. Leverage never used is waste.

**Waste:** Any activity, system or product which does not contribute to our mission, goals and desired outcomes. Waste only occurs if the learning achieved does not inform what we do next.

*Ethical behavior can be measured, satisfaction and happiness too. Many have said that there are many things that matter which cannot be measured. This is lazy thinking and an abdication of our responsibility to make data informed decisions, pressure test our hypothesis and ultimately focus on finding and respecting the truth of our situation.
