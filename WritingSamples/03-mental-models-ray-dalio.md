# Mental Models and Building High-Performance Teams

Reading Ray Dalio's book on Principles I realized I need to write down how I work, how I think about what I do, and why it matters. Both as a matter of record and to solidify in my own mind how to build high-performance teams and deliver outstanding technical systems which truly matter.

## Mental Models

Let's cover the mental models I like to use first.

First a point about Principles, it is a really, really excellent (but dry) read on how to build, manage and operate high functioning organizations capable of achieving outstanding results. Download it here (this is a link to the prior early version). Take it apart, think about why it works, and what you agree or disagree with.

There is a lot to love in Ray's book but one difference in my thinking worth highlighting is that while Mr. Dalio is most interested in taking a top-down view and building out a machine for realizing his goals I see the world a bit differently. Fundamentally I take the view that human organizations are complex systems, meaning that they are by their nature probabilistic not deterministic. When we think about machines we usually imagine them to be complicated but predictable. This means that a naturalistic view of creating an ecosystem, not a machine (a system of interlocking, interdependent systems), is the more useful mental model as it captures the meta-strategies around attractors, actors, boundaries, and the subsequent coherence of the system which results with their interactions.

I like to use the Cynefin model for thinking about situations, organizations, tactics, and strategy. David Snowden the originator of the Cynefin model has given a few talks on this model here and a longer one here. For me, this means I am in the business of building a context for people to do their best work, where that context is an ecosystem that results in a coherence that is highly likely to produce a desirable outcome. In general, that means properly selecting the people, processes, and technologies which fit with the current situation and objectives.

Noting that a critical objective of any system built is that it must also be able to adapt to accommodate probable changes in the competitive landscape and ecosystem it is embedded within. Intentionally building a complex adaptive system can result in a system which is anti-fragile by nature (See this Talk from Nassim Taleb for more depth). The explicit intention to build ant-fragile organizations which take advantage is a crucial distinction and must be an intended outcome as resilient systems are good, but systems which get stronger under stress are ideal.

## Systems and Attractors

Given the above mental models as a jumping off point, here are some of the systems/attractors and approaches I find useful when putting together and managing an ecosystem.

**Define the problem.** First and always start with Why. Simon Senek gave a great talk on always starting with Why… and he is spot on. First and foremost, people care about why you are doing what you are doing. Ensuring you are clear about your intentions and the underlying "why" also ties into John Boyd's concepts of Grand Strategy but we will leave that for a longer essay on policy and competition.

Once you have the problem defined, thinking about WHO has the problem and what it means to them is the next step. Clayton Christensen's work on Job's to be Done is probably one of the best mental models for this. Read the articles, listen to the Podcasts.

## Double-Check your Assumptions

Once you have a sense of why you are doing what you are doing you need to seek external validation for your beliefs. Eric Ries did a fantastic job of synthesizing a lot of existing thinking on this in his book, The Lean Startup. It builds on the great work from Steve Blank, and others in the Lean Software and Lean Thinking world. Fundamentally Lean is all about ROI, it is about a maniacal focus on taking care of people and creating value. Master these concepts. They are the fundamental processes and attractors you are going to use to build out your system for creating new businesses, software systems, and ecologies. I would be remiss if I did not call out Alex Osterwalder and Ash Maurya here too, their work on business canvases is invaluable for how to ask the big and important questions and then validate those questions. A good recent introduction to Lean Canvas is here.

Once you have Lean as a set of core concepts you need to understand Agility. In part, this means understanding things like the Agile Manifesto, but more it means understanding the OODA loop and the underlying information processing theories of John Boyd.

SDLC process like Scrum, KANBAN, and the Scaled Agile framework are decent methods for organizing work once you know a bit of what you are doing. But be aware, you need to understand why these frameworks work and then be prepared to use your knowledge of the underlying theory to adapt the system to your current needs. If you can't or won't change what you are doing, guess what…you are not Agile.

## People

Thinking about people, how do you select the people who can do the work? Who will have the character, temperament, and skills to do the work when it is hard? When it is novel and when you are solving problems nobody else has solved before? Noting that if you are doing important work if you are doing work that truly matters it is going to be hard, and in fact, the level of difficulty can make all the difference to your ability to build competitive advantages. Or as Paul Graham says, Run up stairs.

How do we evaluate people? How do we know what they are like? How do we evaluate their character? For the first question I like to think about different personality types, lately, I have been using the The Big Five Personality traits. In this model, you generally want to find people who have a high openness to experience, high conscientiousness, a good amount of agreeableness, and low neuroticism. You want teams of people with a mixture of extraverted and introverted. In terms of character traits, I always index high for integrity, courage, and character.

A person of character is someone who has a track record of integrity and courage even and especially when the situation is tough and they have a lot to lose. When interviewing always dig in to find specific examples of behavior which demonstrates the personality and character traits you need for your teams. Do not accept hypothetical answers. Past performance is the best indicator of future performance.

## Key Ideas/Guiding Principles

At this point you have a system of processes in place which can evolve and adapt, you have a carefully selected team of people who can do the work, and you are executing. There are some key ideas you have to keep in mind as you move forward.

Those are specific guiding principles for day to day operations. These simple rules form the basis of a strategy which will keep you and your team synchronized and aligned with the principles outlined above and will help drive you forward. They are:

1. **Always keep the end in mind.** Define success in simple, clear terms. Repeat it often. This usually means simplifying your business goals down to an essential 3 or 4 concise objectives. When starting a project, define the key outcome(s) which have to result. You should be able to explain your business goals, your team's goals, and your project goals to a savvy 5-year-old. Use tools like Commander's Intent and written Mission statements to clarify your objectives (OKRs are helpful here too). Then, work to achieve this vision, live by the mission, and deliver the objectives.

2. **Planning is essential but plans are worthless.** Plan to replan. Be Agile but have a constantly evolving and updating roadmap. Know your approach, decision points, and actively manage your risks and trade-offs. Do this weekly or daily depending on how things are going. Having walked through multiple scenarios (invariant representations of potential futures) you are prepared when things change, if you have walked the as Sun Tzu would say, you are prepared to take advantage of the unexpected upside or cap your downside. Measure your cost of delay and focus on flowing work swiftly through your systems.

3. **Treat people like volunteers.** Volunteers have intrinsic motivations for serving something bigger than themselves. They are each distinct individuals and to inspire their attention, their drive, and passion you have to know what they want and need from their experiences, their day to day activities, and their ultimate goals. Find out what your people are like, work to give them what they need, and treat them with respect and caring. People want to experience autonomy while achieving mastery towards a purpose bigger themselves. Help them do that.

4. **Write everything down.** People forget things, don't let them. Writing crystallizes thoughts into cohesive narratives and arguments. Writing inspires action. This means, document meetings, plans, systems, people's performance, what happened, why things succeeded, and why they failed. Share what you write and get in the habit of continuous learning and improvement. Writing and communicating is key.

5. **Challenge the status quo.** Question the (your!) assumptions and look for shadow beliefs which hold you back. Learn and improve continuously. Build fast feedback loops and encourage an active culture of celebrating failure and learning. Actively expand everyone's mental complexity.

6. **Hold the standard!** We are our habits and a team does not rise to the level of the challenge, they fall to the level of their practice. Define a standard of performance for how your teams operate, be clear on expectations for execution but encourage initiative and improvisation.

7. **Make decisions based upon data and the validation of constantly tested hypothesis.** Make bets wisely and buy information. Evaluate the level of quality needed for each delivery and ship systems into production in their simplest forms to learn. Focus, focus, and more focus. MVPs are your friend, although be sure to distinguish between foundational systems where more care must be taken vs. leaf nodes in your systems where tech debt can be more freely spent or your risks are easier to manage with much less potential for long term, widespread negative side effects. Always watch the perimeters of your systems, instrument them as needed, and use good tools to visualize system metrics and performance.

8. **Communicate clearly, appropriately, and relentlessly.** Everybody talks. We are all leaders. Be hard on the idea, not the person.

## Conclusions

Underneath all of the above be clear about your philosophy, the underlying principles which govern the why, what and how of your methods. Use a set of statements to frame your team's understanding, something like: "First and always, start something, then learn. Repeat. Keep the end in mind, be rigorous and seek counsel. Use data to make decisions. Make smart bets. Ask questions. Fiercely take ownership of outcomes. Be the leader you want."

Good luck on your journey and reach out if you have questions on the above.
