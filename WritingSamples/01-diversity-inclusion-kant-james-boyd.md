# Diversity, Inclusion, Equity, and the Foundations of High-Performance Teams

Diversity, inclusion, equity, openness, psychological safety and trust are key to performance, organizational health, and the creation of competitive advantage - and they are also categorical imperatives - unalloyed goods all on their own.

So why is it then that many teams and organizations only give lip service to these principles while others value them but fail to embrace them fully?

I hypothesize that there is a failure to do this because managers and leaders lack the underlying conceptual understanding of how these traits, cultural norms, and values interact to create just organizations where people can thrive and do their best work while also delivering outstanding results.

Why is that? I believe that the drive for results at all costs without stopping to think and understand what conditions create those results is a failing not only in education but in the creation of ethical systems of value creation where people are valued not as a means to an end, but as people.

So let's talk about that and see if we can have a conversation about how to rethink and recommit to creating the kinds of organizations, teams, and jobs where people can truly live a good life.

Frankly, there should not be much debate about this; this has been studied extensively for years across cultures and industries. If you want to win and thrive - then diversity, inclusion, equity, openness, psychological safety, and trust; plus their enablers: humility, openness, and fairness, are a must. The benefits of inculcating the primacy of these values, behaviors, and principles are that you will achieve better outcomes, make better decisions, solve problems more effectively, and create a more just, safe, and engaging environment for all.

You want that, right?

From first principles, how does this work? One of the key foundations for understanding the importance of these principles is Kantian ethics. Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher, believed that individuals should act in a way that respects the inherent value and dignity of all human beings and ensures that everyone is treated as an end in themselves rather than a means to an end. This principle sets a moral and ethical framing for the importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and openness in the business world. Kantian philosophy is also bedrock as a fundamental aspect of our justice system; it influences every aspect of western civilization.

A second set of fundamental principles was explored by William James' who explained the concept of "radical empiricism" which emphasizes the importance of experience and observation in the acquisition of knowledge. In terms of diversity and inclusivity, this means that individuals should be open to learning from the experiences and perspectives of people who are different from them in order to gain a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the world. This leads to better problem solving and decision making, making people who can learn from the mistakes and lessons of others all that more effective.

Finally, let's add in the ideas of John Boyd's and his foundational concept of the OODA loop, which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. In operating OODA Boyd emphasizes the importance of situational awareness and the ability to quickly adapt to changing circumstances. A team that is diverse, inclusive, and open is better equipped to compete by more effectively and quickly running the OODA loop, as it has a broader understanding of its situation and is able to make better decisions than its competition. Noting that most often, we are competing to survive against nature. See for reference the climate crisis.

In the following essay, I am going to walk through how the ideas of Kant, James, and Boyd interact to create environments where people can do their best work, how these ideas in motion create psychological safety, and its bedrock - trust and belonging.

## Kant's Moral Imperative

Kant's categorical imperative is a moral rule that states that one should always act in a way that they would be willing to make into a universal law. In other words, one should act only in accordance with principles that they would be willing to see become a general rule for everyone to follow. This principle is especially relevant in the context of diversity and inclusion. It is fundamental when considering how to create fair and equitable rules, processes, and culture.

I think we can all agree that treating all individuals with dignity and respect, ensuring that everyone is treated as an end in themselves, rather than a means to an end, is not only a moral obligation but how each of us would prefer to be treated. It is essential for creating a just and equitable business environment. For example, in a business setting, this principle would mean that all employees should be treated with respect, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. It would also mean that all employees should be given equal opportunities to succeed and advance within the company. By treating all employees with dignity and respect and by creating a culture of inclusion, businesses can foster a more productive and engaged workforce.

Kant believed, as do I, that individuals have inherent value and dignity. Therefore it is important to consider the impact of our actions on others and to make sure that we are not treating others as means to an end. To live in a just world this principle must be universally applied in how we treat employees, suppliers, customers, the community, and the environment in which the business operates. By considering the impact of our actions on others, we can ensure that we are not exploiting or harming others for our own gain. Again, it is basic, but it is how we all want to be treated, right? It is the world we all would like to live in, right?

I know, I know it is not that simple, and we often fail at this, but could we all agree that this is what we want and then work towards that?

## Radical Empiricism

The value of diversity and inclusion in decision-making and problem-solving can be understood through William James' concept of radical empiricism. This concept emphasizes the importance of experience and observation in the acquisition of knowledge (sense-making and meaning-making).

In terms of diversity and inclusion, this means that individuals should be open to learning from the experiences and perspectives of people who are different from them, in order to gain a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the world. By embracing diverse perspectives, teams can better understand the complexities of any given situation or problem. For example, a team comprised solely of men may have difficulty understanding how gender bias affects certain decisions or outcomes. By including women on the team, they can gain insight into how gender bias may be impacting their decisions or outcomes.

You want to make better decisions, right? Actually, you want to make decisions that are more coherent and fit for your current situation, right? Because you want to survive and thrive, right?

Additionally, by having members with different backgrounds and experiences on a team, they can bring unique perspectives that could lead to innovative solutions to problems or new ways of looking at an issue. Furthermore, by having a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences, teams are better equipped to make informed decisions that take into account all stakeholders involved. Diverse teams will also be more likely to consider multiple points of view when making decisions as well as identify potential unintended consequences that could arise from their actions. This leads to better decision-making as well as improved problem solving capabilities since teams are able to think outside their constraining frames when it comes to tackling difficult issues.

To do this well, people and teams must commit to a culture of transparency, openness, trust, and humility. Managers and leaders must strive to listen, and commit to creating psychological safety to foster the ability to truly see and understand the world. This is not merely the right thing to do; it is fundamentally necessary for the creation of durable competitive advantage and starkly put survival.

## Situational Awareness and the OODA Loop

John Boyd developed the OODA loop, his conceptual framework for competition, during his time as a fighter pilot when he initially could not figure out how it was that American fighter pilots flying objectively weaker, and slower fighter jets prevailed against their faster and more powerful adversaries. Was it training? Certainly, but more so, it was situational awareness, and the follow on sense making, meaning making, and action that followed. It was the speed or tempo of running OODA which made all the difference.

OODA stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. This means that in order to effectively navigate any situation or problem, one must first observe their environment, orient themselves with the current situation, decide on an appropriate course of action, and then act on it.

In terms of diversity and inclusion, this means that having a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences is essential for effectively navigating the OODA loop. A diverse team is better equipped to observe their environment more accurately as they have access to multiple perspectives, leading to better decision-making.

This parallax in seeing the world is key!

Having members with diverse backgrounds and experiences on a team also means that they have a wider range of perspectives to draw upon when assessing a situation and determining the best course of action. This diversity of perspective allows the team to consider multiple viewpoints and options when making decisions, leading to more informed and well-rounded decisions.

Furthermore, by having a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences, the team is better equipped to anticipate and respond to the consequences of their actions, as well as to identify potential unintended consequences that may arise. This allows them to adjust and take corrective actions as needed, leading to better outcomes.

There are several key traits that enable teams to thrive when running the OODA loop quickly: openness within a team means people are more likely to effectively process feedback from others which can help them act more quickly and effectively in response to changing circumstances. High trust, low ego environments mean people will be able to listen, and hear new ideas that might conflict with their own views, ideas, and more deeply identities.

By embracing diversity, inclusion, humility, and openness within teams, businesses can create an environment of psychological safety where everyone feels heard, valued, and appreciated, ultimately leading to a greater likelihood of survival, success, and thriving.

## Conclusion

Diversity, inclusion, humility, and openness are essential to success in business. Kantian ethics set a moral and ethical framework for the importance of these principles by emphasizing the importance of treating all individuals with dignity and respect. Applying Kant's fundamental idea of the categorical imperative to business and life sets the stage for the creation of a more just, equitable, and fair world. Creating teams and organizations which embrace these ideas pragmatically improves their outcomes while also being the RIGHT THING to do morally and ethically.

The concept of radical empiricism emphasizes the importance of experience and observation in the acquisition of knowledge, which leads to better problem solving and decision making. This leads naturally into the OODA loop, and Boyd's view that situational awareness and adaptability in any given situation or problem is paramount for survival and thriving. A high trust, diverse team that is inclusive and open is better equipped to navigate the OODA loop as it has a broader understanding of the situation and can make better decisions based on multiple perspectives.

By embracing diversity, inclusion, humility, and openness within teams, businesses can create an environment where everyone feels and is valued, seen, and heard.

In order for this to happen, all of us must be humble and open so that we can listen to different perspectives and new ideas.

If we can foster an environment where everyone feels respected and valued, we will see inevitable improvements in decision-making, problem-solving capabilities, productivity, engagement levels, customer satisfaction rates, and employee retention rates – all leading to greater success for their organization.

And maybe, if we all really lean into this, we can also create a just, equitable, and fair world.

Wouldn't that just be great?
