# The LLM Gold Rush

Many of the ChatGPT examples (here, here) I have shared are examples of ways a savvy organization could leverage LLM-backed AI services in their SaaS product, and many newly minted companies are now on the march to build entire businesses around a handful of smart, effective prompts; they will combine some light UI glue and add a compelling pitch, and voila instant SaaS company.

This gold rush to create generic or purpose-built writing aids, recipe generators, legal recommenders, semantic search engines, and many more systems that generate or summarize text, analyze text, perform entity recognition, write code, and much more is already well in motion. And a considerable amount of money will be made this way, but it will be short-lived if this technology is not built into a compelling product with an effective business/operating model, architecture, software systems, and teams. For this technology to provide durable value, it must be used as leverage and accelerant, not mainly by itself or with a thin veneer of technology and process.

Of course, who makes most of the money in a gold rush — those that sell picks and shovels. OpenAI the company behind ChatGPT, GPT-3, Dall-E (and much more) estimates they will book $1 billion in revenue in 2024; this will certainly be on the back of many successful but short-lived businesses. But it will also be due to many smart companies who take the time to really deeply consider how to create immense value for their customers using this technology, more on that in a minute. Let's ensure we are on the same page about this technology and how it can be used. If you already know this, skip ahead.

LLMs (Large Language Models) like GPT-3 excel at natural language processing tasks. They can generate human-like text, translate text between languages, understand the meaning and context of words and phrases, extract relevant information from large amounts of text, classify text into different categories, and summarize long documents or articles. These capabilities can be applied to a wide range of business use cases, such as generating personalized marketing emails, translating customer support tickets for global companies, analyzing sentiment in customer feedback, extracting data from business documents, sifting for spam emails, summarizing long articles for quick review, and extracting meaning, sentiment, and actions from transcribed audio recordings of meetings.

These are frankly incredible in their variety and power, and as a guy just playing around with these, I am blown away. However, as a leader in technology, it is clear that we have to consider where this technology is going to go, and what parts of it will become commodity capabilities that will be built into existing tools and systems and which parts are going to enable net new business models and/or systemic capabilities.

To note it again, a business built solely based on a smart set of prompts will not have much of a competitive moat. Why? Prompts will leak, LLMs are constantly improving, and what was once a whole company will one day soon be achievable with a dumb(er) prompt and a smarter AI (GPT-4 will be here soon). This should not stop you from considering how your company or personal productivity can be improved with this technology. It is a caution that durable long-term value can not be created with this technology alone.

There are a few incredible examples to model and follow; thus far my favorite example of how to use LLMs to create huge value takes the form of CoPilot from Github. Microsoft estimates developers using CoPilot have it write 35% to 40% of the code of their code, a massive productivity gain. It is built on top of OpenAI codex GPT-3 variant, which also appears to be baked into ChatGPT.

To dig into the details of CoPilot check-out this fantastic analysis and toolchain for exploring its architecture, design, and prompts. I particularly found the methods they created for prioritizing what surrounding code to inject into the prompt for code generation to be really smart.

I have also been impressed with the approach https://www.sudowrite.com/ is taking within their AI Writer tools, having played around with it and knowing several writers who are finding huge value in using tools like it to write, more, better faster. To find more tools like this for modeling, and evaluation check out this incredibly comprehensive list from Joanna Penn.

Other places to start when thinking about how you could use LLMs to solve problems as leverage and accelerant can be found at width.ai; they have a highly informative set of case studies on how to apply this technology to solve hard, previously intractable problems. Their write-up on Processing Master Service Agreements With Multi-Task GPT-3 Model for Blended Summarization & Dynamic NER was really helpful in understanding the process of fitting LLMs into a data pipeline with summarization and entity extraction. They also discuss in detail how this system creates huge value for their client.

Many new projects are emerging as backends for chaining and combining LLMs, a particularly exciting project I am watching and experimenting with is Langchain a Python project designed to help build composable solutions using LLMs. As they say in their readme, "using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app — the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This project is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications." Here is a very simple and easy example of Langchain in action.

## Conclusion

It is important to consider where Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are going and how they can be used to create customer value. While LLMs excel at natural language processing tasks and have a wide range of business applications, it is crucial to remember that building a business solely on a smart set of prompts will not be sustainable in the long term. To create durable value with this technology, it must be leveraged as an accelerant and integrated into a compelling product with a strong business model, architecture, software systems, and teams.

Lastly, and critically as we consider the numerous opportunities for utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to drive innovation and growth in our organizations, it is also essential to reflect upon the ethical concerns related to this technology. We must approach the use of LLMs with caution and consider the potential consequences of their deployment. This includes evaluating the potential impacts on society and marginalized groups, implementing safeguards to prevent misuse, and being transparent about the capabilities and limitations of these systems. By adopting a responsible and ethical approach to the use of LLMs, we can ensure that they are a driving force for positive change in our organizations and in the world.
