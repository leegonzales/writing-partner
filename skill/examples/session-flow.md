# Example Session Flow

A complete example of using the writing-partner skill from interview to calibrated draft.

---

## Setup

**Topic:** Why prose-polish matters
**Goal:** Authentic essay that sounds like Lee, not AI

---

## Phase 1: Interview

### Opening

**User:** "I want to write about why I built prose-polish"

**Writing Partner (Interview Mode):**

"Let's start with why this topic. Of all the skills you've built, why does prose-polish pull your attention right now?"

**User:** "Because I keep seeing AI-generated content that's technically correct but soulless. And the essay I wrote about prose-polish on day one? It doesn't sound like me. It was written BY Claude, not BY me with Claude's help."

**Writing Partner:**

"Marking [MAIN: Collaborative emergence vs. AI generation].

What's the distinction for you between 'written by Claude' and 'written by you with Claude's help'?"

**User:** "When I write with Claude, I provide the spark—the insight, the taste, the thing I actually think. Claude helps me find the words to express it. When Claude writes for me, it invents things I never said and shapes arguments I don't recognize."

**Writing Partner:**

"Marking [TANGENT: Division of labor—spark vs. words].

That phrase 'intellectual prosthesis' came up earlier. Is that the distinction? Prosthesis extends your capability vs. replacement does your thinking?"

**User:** "Exactly. A prosthetic limb lets YOU walk. It doesn't walk for you while you watch. Same with writing. I want Claude to be my intellectual prosthesis—extending my reach, not replacing my voice."

---

### Deepening

**Writing Partner (continuing interview):**

"What's your actual experience with this? When have you personally felt the difference between prosthesis and replacement?"

**User:** "The day one essay about prose-polish. I asked Claude to write about it, gave some context, and got back something that read like a marketing blog post. 'In today's world of AI-generated content...' — I would never write that. It had claims about my experience that weren't true. Fabrications."

**Writing Partner:**

"Marking [RESEARCH: Day one essay as concrete example of failure].

What specifically felt off when you read it?"

**User:** "The AI tells. 'You might think X, but actually Y.' I've started noticing that pattern everywhere. It's Claude trying to create artificial insight. Real insight doesn't need that setup."

**Writing Partner:**

"Marking [COUNTER: The 'you might think' pattern as identified AI tell].

This is your observation, not mine. You've identified this pattern from experience. What else did you notice?"

**User:** "Perfect grammar but zero friction. Nothing snags. When I write, there's rhythm variation—short sentences, then a longer one. Parenthetical asides where I'm thinking out loud. The AI version was smooth like glass. Glass is pretty but you can't grip it."

---

### Thread Summary

**Writing Partner:**

"Here's what we have:

**[MAIN]** Collaborative emergence vs. AI generation—prose-polish exists to enable the first, detect the second

**[TANGENT]** Division of labor—human provides spark/taste/vision, AI provides words/elevation

**[TANGENT]** Intellectual prosthesis metaphor—extension vs. replacement

**[RESEARCH]** Day one essay as concrete failure example

**[COUNTER]** 'You might think' as identified AI tell (your observation)

**[COUNTER]** 'Perfect but frictionless' as another tell

The angle is clear: Prose-polish isn't just about detecting AI writing—it's about enabling collaborative emergence where the human stays in the driver's seat.

Ready to draft, or more to explore?"

**User:** "Let's draft."

## Phase 2: Drafting

**Writing Partner (Drafting Mode):**

"Loading WritingSamples/essays/beads-launch.md as voice reference.

Patterns I'm matching:
- Direct, first-person opening
- Concrete example early
- Thinking-out-loud parentheticals
- Short sentences punctuating longer explanations

Here's an opening:

---

I built prose-polish because I was tired of reading my own essays and not recognizing myself.

The day one essay about this very skill? Written by Claude, not with Claude. It had the facts right and the voice wrong. 'In today's world of AI-generated content'—I don't talk like that. Nobody does, except AI pretending to be thoughtful.

Here's what I actually think: AI writing has a tell. Not one tell—a whole taxonomy of them. The 'you might think X, but actually Y' move. The perfect-grammar-zero-friction problem. The invented anecdotes I never lived. I started building prose-polish to catch these patterns. But somewhere along the way, I realized detection isn't the point.

The point is collaborative emergence.

---

How's that land?"

---

## Phase 3: Calibration

**User:** "Pretty good. Something feels slightly off in the third paragraph."

**Writing Partner (Calibration Mode):**

"Running calibration on paragraph 3...

**Blocklist check:** No matches on tier 1 patterns.

**Rhythm check:** Three roughly equal-length sentences in a row ('The you might think...' / 'The perfect-grammar...' / 'The invented anecdotes...'). Your samples show more variation—a short sentence breaking the pattern.

**Comparing to WritingSamples/essays/beads-launch.md:**

Your pattern there:
'The problem isn't tracking. (Everyone has lists.) The problem is losing the thread when context shifts.'

Notice the parenthetical breaking the rhythm?

**Suggested revision:**

'Here's what I actually think: AI writing has a tell. (Actually, a whole taxonomy of tells.) The "you might think X, but actually Y" move. Perfect grammar, zero friction—nothing to grip. Invented anecdotes I never lived.'

Want to try that version?"

**User:** "Yes, that's better. The parenthetical feels like me."

## Phase 4: Continue & Verify

**Writing Partner:**

"Updated draft:

Running final prose-polish check...

**Score: 18** (below threshold)

No major flags. The parenthetical and rhythm variation read as human. The concrete example (day one essay) grounds the abstract claim.

Ready to continue with the next section, or refine this more?"

## Session Summary

**What worked:**
- Interview extracted concrete experience (day one essay failure)
- Lee's own observations became the examples (AI tells he identified)
- Voice reference (WritingSamples/) caught rhythm mismatch
- Calibration improved without over-polishing

**Threads for next section:**
- [TANGENT] Intellectual prosthesis metaphor—ready to develop
- [MAIN] Collaborative emergence—needs deeper explanation
- [COUNTER] "But what if detection is enough?"—address later

---

**This is the skill in action.** Interview first, track threads, draft from real material, calibrate against samples.
