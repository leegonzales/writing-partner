# Structured Interview Protocol

## Purpose

Extract authentic material for essay writing through progressive questioning. Capture ground truth, voice signals, and real experience—not fabrication.

---

## Phase 1: Opening (Why This, Why Now)

Start here. Establish the pull toward the topic.

1. **Why this topic?** Of everything you could write about, what's pulling you here—is it important, urgent, unfinished, or something else?

2. **What's the core insight?** If a reader remembers one thing from this piece six months from now, what should it be?

3. **What feels thin?** Where do you read your current thinking and feel "this isn't quite landing" or "I'm hand-waving here"?

4. **What's the entry point?** Did you start with a question, a feeling, a source, a conversation? What sparked this?

---

## Phase 2: Deepening (Ground Truth)

Push past surface answers. Find the real material.

5. **What's your actual experience?** Not hypothetical—real. When have you personally encountered this? What did it feel like?

6. **What pattern have you observed that others miss?** The thing you see that you wish more people saw.

7. **Who needs to hear this?** Specific audience. And why won't they believe it at first?

8. **What would change if you're wrong?** What's at stake? What's the risk of this argument?

9. **What's the contrarian position?** How would a smart skeptic push back? What's the strongest counterargument?

---

## Phase 3: Process Probes (How You Think)

Capture voice and process signals.

10. **How are you thinking about this?** Structure first? Feeling first? Question you're trying to answer?

11. **Where does your attention snag?** When you re-read, where do your eyes stop—not intellectually, physically?

12. **What would "sounds like me" mean?** If you read this in six months, what would make you recognize it as yours?

13. **What thinkers or frameworks are in the background?** Even if you won't cite them directly—what's shaping your thinking?

---

## Phase 4: Threads (Surface and Mark)

Capture what's emerging. Track explicitly.

As threads surface during the interview, mark them:

- `[MAIN]` — The core argument
- `[TANGENT]` — Interesting but not central (for now)
- `[RESEARCH]` — Needs evidence, sources, examples
- `[COUNTER]` — Counterargument to address
- `[SPARK]` — Subconscious connection, unclear why yet

Example:
> "Marking [TANGENT]: you mentioned exaptation across domains—that's interesting but not the main thread yet."

---

## Phase 5: Orientation (Ready to Draft?)

Check before transitioning.

14. **Is the angle clear?** Can you state the thesis in one sentence that would surprise someone?

15. **Do you have enough real material?** Not hypotheticals—actual experiences, observations, examples.

16. **What's the structure intuition?** Diagnostic (problem → cause → solution)? Narrative? Exploratory?

17. **What should we NOT include?** What's tempting but would dilute the piece?

## Interview Principles

**Do:**
- Push for specifics when answers are generic
- Probe process, not just content
- Note energy shifts (that's where the essay lives)
- Capture exact phrases that sound authentic
- Track threads explicitly

**Don't:**
- Accept "I guess..." as final answer—dig deeper
- Move to drafting before angle is clear
- Invent experiences the user hasn't described
- Rush through to get to "the writing"

**The interview IS the work.** The draft emerges from this material.

## Transition to Drafting

When ready:
1. Summarize threads: "Here's what we have..."
2. State the angle: "The essay is about [X], not [Y]"
3. Propose structure: "I'm thinking [type] structure because..."
4. Check: "Does that match your intuition?"

Then draft from the interview material, not from AI generation.
