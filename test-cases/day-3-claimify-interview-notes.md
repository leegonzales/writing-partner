# Claimify Interview Notes (Day 3)

**Date:** 2025-12-19
**Status:** Interview complete, awaiting Claimify subagent report, then draft

---

## Ground Truth Findings

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Stakeholder meeting story | **Composite** | Based on real meetings, dramatized |
| Six-type taxonomy | **Research synthesis** | Claude researched argumentation theory, synthesized together |
| Red-team example in draft | **Constructed** | Needs replacement or honest framing |
| Microsoft paper origin | **Real** | LLMs can do claim extraction - need to find and link |

## Key Interview Insights

### Real Origin (not meetings)
- "Hot garbage essays" with unsupported claims
- Russell conjugation, manipulation, slanting
- Needed to make sense of essays, articles, documents at work
- Become better writer AND thinker
- Microsoft paper/experiment showed LLMs could do this

### Real Usage
- Substack essays, news articles, YouTube transcripts
- ANY text where he thinks "what is this really claiming?"
- Detecting covert manipulation, slanting, framing
- Wants to wire it into every system that puts tokens into his mind
- Red-teams own drafts regularly (no single standout example)

### Core Insight
- **Cornerstone of good thinking**
- **Protecting personal information ecology**
- **Guard against memetic warfare and weak thinking**
- "Manipulation of the many by the few"

### Manipulation Angle
- BOTH intentional (propaganda) and unintentional (sloppy thinking)
- Spectrum from innocent sloppiness to deliberate manipulation

## Confirmed Angle

> **Claimify is epistemic self-defense.**
>
> The internet is full of well-written hot garbage—essays with unsupported claims, Russell conjugation, covert manipulation disguised as argument. I needed a tool to see through it. Not occasionally—constantly. Claimify makes invisible logic visible, and I want it wired into every system that puts tokens into my mind.

## Tone & Scope Decisions

- **Tone:** More serious, more urgent than Days 1-2
- **Scope:** Full rewrite - lead with manipulation/memetic warfare angle
- **NOT:** Meeting summary tool framing

---

## Thread Map

### MAIN
1. Epistemic self-defense — guard mind from manipulation
2. Wire Claimify into everything that puts tokens in your mind
3. Both intentional and unintentional bad arguments

### TANGENT
4. Better writer AND thinker (dual purpose)
5. Six-type taxonomy (from research synthesis - be honest)

### RESEARCH
6. Microsoft paper origin - find and link
7. METR report example - subagent running (agent ID: a6f5039)

### COUNTER
8. Current draft examples are weak - need real example (METR analysis)

---

## Structure Plan

1. Hook with real problem (manipulation everywhere, not meetings)
2. What Claimify does (extraction + classification + mapping)
3. The taxonomy (honest: from research synthesis)
4. Real example: METR report analysis (from subagent)
5. Why it matters: epistemic self-defense + better thinking/writing
6. How I use it (regular practice, cornerstone habit)
7. The bigger picture: memetic warfare, protecting information ecology

---

## Next Steps

1. Get Claimify subagent report on METR document
2. Cherry-pick examples for essay
3. Draft full essay from interview material
4. Calibrate voice
5. Score session
